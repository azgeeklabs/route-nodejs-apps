src/modules/subCategory/subCategory.controller.js#L20

=> is it a good idea to add a third parameter to getAll to accept filterObj?

Looking at your code, I notice a potential issue with how `getAll` and `getAllSubCategories` are working together. While adding a `filterObj` parameter is a good idea for flexibility, there's a bug in your current implementation.

The main issue is in `getAllSubCategories` - it's not returning or awaiting the `getAll` function call. Here's how to fix it:

```javascript:e-commerce/src/modules/subCategory/subCategory.controller.js
const getAllSubCategories = catchError(async (req, res, next) => {
  const filterObj = {};
  if (req.params.categorySlug) filterObj.category = req.params.categorySlug;
  return getAll(SubCategory, ["name", "description"], filterObj)(req, res, next);
});
```

Regarding your question: Yes, having the `filterObj` parameter in `getAll` is a good practice because:

1. It provides flexibility to filter records based on different conditions
2. It allows reusability across different controllers while maintaining specific filtering needs
3. It keeps the filtering logic centralized in the generic handler
4. It's particularly useful for related data queries like getting subcategories for a specific category

The current implementation is good, but just remember that `getAll` returns a middleware function that needs to be called with `(req, res, next)`. That's why the fix above includes returning and passing these parameters.

===================================================

=> Which better in getAllSubCategories? be returning or awaiting the getAll function call?

In this case, **returning** is better than awaiting. Here's why:

1. `getAll` returns a middleware function that already handles the async/await internally
2. If you use `await`, you would need to duplicate the response handling logic

Let me show you both approaches to illustrate why returning is better:

```javascript:e-commerce/src/modules/subCategory/subCategory.controller.js
// ✅ BETTER: Return approach
const getAllSubCategories = catchError(async (req, res, next) => {
  const filterObj = {};
  if (req.params.categorySlug) filterObj.category = req.params.categorySlug;
  return getAll(SubCategory, ["name", "description"], filterObj)(req, res, next);
});

// ❌ WORSE: Await approach
const getAllSubCategories = catchError(async (req, res, next) => {
  const filterObj = {};
  if (req.params.categorySlug) filterObj.category = req.params.categorySlug;
  // This would execute the middleware but you'd need to handle the response yourself
  await getAll(SubCategory, ["name", "description"], filterObj)(req, res, next);
  // You'd need to duplicate response handling here
});
```

The return approach is better because:
1. It maintains the error handling chain
2. It avoids code duplication
3. It properly passes control to the generic handler
4. It's more maintainable as any changes to response handling in `getAll` will automatically apply
